    "nextClient": "Myself",
    "nextProblem": "Already familiar with React.js thanks to my school curriculum and being aware that a large extent of technologies require only to be discovered, it was necessary to set foot in the stirrup in order to draw the maximum benefit and be able to keep up to date in the face of all existing offers. \nIn addition, it was important that these technos offer a pleasant developer experience and that they were well anchored in the landscape to ensure rich documentation and high scalability potential.",
